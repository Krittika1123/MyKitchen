    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                1.75 cups khoya/mawa, grated or crumbled, approx 1.75 cups
            </li>
            <li>
                4 tbsp all-purpose flour
            </li>
            <li>
                1/2 tsp baking powder
            </li>
            <li>
                1/4 tsp cardamom powder
            </li>
            <li>
                4-5 tbsp warm milk / water
            </li>
            <li>
                2 cups granulated sugar
            </li>
            <li>
                2.5 cups water
            </li>
            <li>
                1/2 tbsp lemon juice
            </li>
            <li>
                4-5 cardamom pods or 1/2 tsp cardamom powder
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <h1 id="h2"> Method </h1>
    <h1 id="h3"> Prepare the dough </h1>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                If using frozen mawa, bring it to room temperature. Grate the block of mawa and transfer to a shallow bowl/plate.
            </li>
            <li>
                Knead the mawa with the heels of your palm for 1-2 minutes. Then add sifted flour, along with cardamom powder, and baking
                 powder.
            </li>
            <li>
                Mix the ingredients well using your fingertips. Then add milk, a tablespoon at a time, and knead gently just until the dough
                comes together with minimal cracks. (Do not add too much milk in a go, or else the dough will become too soft and sticky. 
                If that happens, add more flour and knead until the dough is nice and soft. Do not overwork the dough. If using homemade 
                mawa, you may not need the milk or water at all to knead, as homemade mawa is moist enough, and the flour will absorb the 
                excess moisture.)
            </li>
            <li>
                Cover the dough with a clean kitchen napkin and set it aside for 15 minutes.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <h1 id="h3"> Prepare the sugar syrup </h1>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                While the dough is resting, prepare the sugar syrup. Add water and sugar in a heavy-bottomed saucepan.You may add some 
                crushed cardamom pods now instead of adding the powder later. Bring it to a rolling boil. Then reduce the heat to medium-
                low and let the sugar syrup simmer for 7-8 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Next, add lemon juice, gulab jal (rose water) or saffron along with cardamom powder. Mix well and switch off the heat. 
                The sugar syrup consistency for gulab jamun should be sticky, there is no need for a one string consistency. Remove the
                 pan off the heat and set aside.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p> Gulab Jamun is ready to be served! </p>
    <p> Enjoy! </p>
